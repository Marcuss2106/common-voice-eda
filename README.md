## Common Voice Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores the [Mozilla Common Voice 13.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_13_0) dataset using Python, pandas, and seaborn. The goal is to better understand the structure, quality, and demographics of publicly available speech data as a foundation for building a custom, dialect-aware text-to-speech (TTS) model.

My ultimate goal is to build a custom, dialect-aware TTS model, and this exploration helped me understand the structure and diversity of real-world speech corpora.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the `test.tsv` split of Common Voice 13.0
- Understand speaker demographics (age, gender, accent)
- Analyze sentence length distribution
- Identify potential biases and data quality issues
- Build intuition for data preprocessing needs in TTS pipelines
